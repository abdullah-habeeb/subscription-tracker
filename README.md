* **Real-time Data Syncing:** The UI updates instantly across all sessions when data is changed in the database, thanks to Firestore's `onSnapshot` listener.
* **Data Visualization:** A dynamic pie chart built with **Chart.js** provides a clean breakdown of monthly costs by category.
* **Backend Automation:** A **Firebase Cloud Function** runs on a schedule (every morning at 8 AM) to check for bills due in 3 days.
